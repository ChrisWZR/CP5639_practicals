Logic Exercise
To determine the contents of all three boxes, you only need to remove a
minimum of 1 marble. Since the problem states that each box label is
incorrect, when you choose to take marbles from the box labeled "1 black
and 1 white," it means there are either 2 white marbles or 2 black marbles
in this box.

If you take out the white marbles, then this box must contain 2 white
marbles, while the other two boxes will each contain 2 black marbles and
2 different-colored marbles. Finally, since the two remaining labels are
"2 black marbles" and "2 white marbles," and the box with 2 black marbles
cannot be paired with the label of 2 black marbles, the box with 2 black
marbles must match the label of 2 white marbles. The contents of the
remaining box can be confirmed in the same way.

Similarly, if you pick a black marble at the beginning, you can follow the
ame process to determine the contents of all three boxes.
