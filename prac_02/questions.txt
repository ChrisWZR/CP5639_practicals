Logic Exercise
I need to take at least 3 socks to be sure of getting a pair of the same color.
When I pick two socks at random, there are three possibilities:

1. Both socks are black.
2. Both socks are white.
3. One black sock and one white sock.

In case 1 and 2, I already have a pair of the same color. In case 3, you need to
pick one more sock. If the third one is black, I will have a pair of black socks,
and if it's white, I will have a pair of white socks.
