Logic Exercise
The conclusion is that Bill is the youngest and Alice is the oldest.
Because if Alice is the youngest, then Carl is not the youngest, then
Alice is the oldest. This result is conflicting and Alice cannot be
both the youngest and the oldest. So Alice is not the youngest, then
Bill is the youngest, then Carl cannot be the youngest, then finally
Alice is the oldest.
The premise of drawing this conclusion is that the ages of the three
children are not equal.
